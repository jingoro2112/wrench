6.0.11 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed #define'd code for code coverage checks to work properly since I'm pretty
  sure the implementation is stable now
- reworked arrays and EX/HASH/MEMBER semantics to fix some issues
- catching "if ()" error in compiler now, empty parenthesis never make sense

6.0.10 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- soime code coverage and a pointer

6.0.9 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- optimized common case of stack-swapping 
- fixed a bug where argument space was allocated twice
- found/fixed a funny little bug where, if it happened in a single operation, a
  loaded hash value might be invalidated by another load requiring the hash table to
  be expanded. The problem with this is values might be stored for a long time, the way
  arrays deal with this is "member of array" but not enough information exists in a WRValue
  to make that work for hashes.. need the full hash AND ref to the table. 
  I have an idea to fix this.. maybe ref to a ref that gets garbage-collected? hmmm...
  -- this required a retooling of hash containers and memory, now fixed
- indexing an array with a string turns it into a hash
- fixed tiny memory leak in compiler, crazy corner case (thanks valgrind!)

6.0.8 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed corner case in string formatting memory issue

6.0.7 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed { if() { return; } } case
- wired user-data test case back in

6.0.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added WRValue* wr_getValueFromContainer( WRValue const& container, const char* name )

6.0.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added protection from Divide-By-Zero

6.0.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed memory allocation for user data, also changed them to use regular
  hash tables so the keys can be iterated
- tightened up string handling, removed extra byte at the end of internal array/strings
- added MallocStrScoped() to manage malloc'ed strings
- added TCP/IP functionality for windows/linux esp32 coming next on my radar
- added tcp/ip debugging in prep for wireless esp32 debugging

6.0.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- version bump for lib

6.0.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- adding time-sliced yield with WRENCH_TIME_SLICES
- adding simple round-robin scheduler
- adding ability to force yield based on instructions processed. only looping/conditional
  instructions are "counted" for speed and simplicity
- stack is now allocated per context instead of per state, to make multi-threading/importing more
  intuitive and scaleable (original state-wide stack was result of earlier GC implementation)
- looked into protecting the stack and the overhead is not all that terrible so added the
  WRENCH_PROTECT_STACK_FROM_OVERFLOW option which will do that
- changed slicing function signatures, globals? really? what was I thinking.
- WRENCH_INCLUDE_DEBUG_CODE now works! basically! have not yet tested it thoroughly
  over a serial link that's next.
- made sure g_free/g_malloc are used everywhere (I had missed a few cases)
- fixed leak in trapRunOutput() (thank you darksotmoon)
- adding to platformIO

6.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- implementated WRENCH_HANDLE_MALLOC_FAIL:

        for embedded systems that need to know if they have run out of memory,

        WARNING: This imposes a small if() check on EVERY INSTRUCTION so the
        malloc failure is detected the moment it happens, but guarantees
        graceful exit if g_malloc() ever returns null

- sprintf rework to use much less stack and have effectively unlimited format/result size
- adding FASTCONTINUE that skips the malloc-fail check on opcodes that can't cause it
- added WRValue::asMallocString() so large stack alocations are unecessary
- fixed up some debug code implementation, still not ready for use!
- removed/relocated includes that were not actually needed globally, increasing compatibility
  with standard c libs

6.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed function declaration being an in-line process (which was to facilitate executing
   serial streams, a feature dropped long ago) to place the table statically into ROM. this
   reduces code and VM size a bit
- salted CRC to ensure valid-but-wrong-version images cannot be executed
- added struct-compare: structs equal each other iff they are the same type and have the
   same value members.
- used WRENCH_NULL_HASH in code streams as well for consistency
- fixed size of hash tables so they properly report ._count now
- added iterator working on strings
- added stl-style iteration of array/hash values

    // c++98 style:
    for ( WRValue::Iterator it = argv->begin(); it != argv->end(); ++it )
    {
        WRIteratorEntry const& value = *it;
        // ...
    }

    // c++11+ style:
    for( WRIteratorEntry const& value : *argv )
    {
        // ...
    }

- breaking up some files that have gotten out of hand to sub-files, particularly in cc.cpp!
- fixed obscure memory overrun with struct comparison (valgrind rides again)

5.0.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added isString() to WRValue
- fixed: bool isString() const;
         bool isWrenchArray() const;
         bool isRawArray() const;
         bool isHashTable() const;
  they were not properly dereferening their arguments
- added array length returns to isString() etc.
- fixed other cases where the value was not being properly dereferenced
- fixed arraySize() in WRValue

5.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- nested container declarations now work:

      var table = { 1, 2, 3, {"key":"value", "key2": 2} };

  now works correctly, creating a 4 element array where the fourth is
  a hash table

- fixed '._remove' to work for arrays as should be expected
- fixed key/value iteration

  

5.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- import! 
  code can now be imported and made available to the running code ie:

    sys::importCompile( "function f1() { return 10; }" );
    print( f1() ); // output will be '10'
 
  sys::importCompile(), sys::importByteCode() and from c wr_import( ... ) are
  all supported with one caveat, structs must be explicitly exported so their namespace
  maps (which are only generated when needed) are generated is:

  --- file1.c:

      struct S { var a = 10; var b = 20 };

  --- file2.c:

      export struct E { var a = 10; var b = 20 };

  --- file3.c:

      var f = io::readFile( "file1.c" );
      sys::importCompile( f );
      var s = new S;  // this will NOT WORK

      f = io::reasdFile( "file2.c" );
      sys::importCompile( f );
      var e = new E;  // this WILL work

  functions do NOT have this restriction. 
  also: imported global space is NOT accessible

    sys::importCompile( "var g = 100;" );
    print( ::g ); // error, 'g' has not been declared

  this required a few byte-code changing changes:
  - units can be "exported" which requires the namespace map to always be
    appended rather than conditionally if a 'new' of them has been performed
  - namespace map always occurs at the start of a unit offset so it can be found
    when imported
  - fixed some minor string based stuffs
- issue #25 fixed, requiring 'var' was not compatible with "foreach" because it was
  creating a temporary incorrectly, fixed.
- added library call sys::halt(...) which allows a program to break the current execution
  with a supplied err code, as long as its higher than 
  WR_USER = 10000, // user-defined below here
  other

4.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thx to: ohordiichuk <notifications@github.com> for the following:
- removed ALL new/delete from code except for in-place new used in the compiler. Since
  I used templates and classes I had no choice.
- purusant to the above, th VM uses NO new/delete at all and should be free from needing
  stdlibc++ at all
- added support for custom allocator at ohordiichuk's suggestion. It's set once
  and used everywhere as a global but should get the job done:

        // by default wrench uses malloc/free but if you want to use your own
        // allocator it can be set up here
        // NOTE: this becomes global for all wrench code!
        typedef void* (*WR_ALLOC)(size_t size);
        typedef void (*WR_FREE)(void* ptr);
        void wr_setGlobalAllocator( WR_ALLOC wralloc, WR_FREE wrfree );

- reworked str.h to add a dynamic formatting option for format/appendFormat
  to both handle small strings more effeciently and handle formats of unlimited
  size


4.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- !!! 'var' NOW REQUIRED to declare variables. This is to cut down on possible typos.
  the non-strict version can still be used to compile older scripts. !!!

- debugger added, VM can now pause/restart and exposes function/line calls
- created debugger client
- created local/remote/in-core debug implementations

- changed the format of bytecode again, requiring a push to 4.*
- created a hierarchy in the discrete_src directory, it was getting cluttered
- added a memory counter to the GC so it won't run EVERY time, that was a 
  convenient hack for a first pass but time to fix it, added:

  #define WRENCH_DEFAULT_ALLOCATED_MEMORY_GC_HINT 4000
  void wr_setAllocatedMemoryGCHint( WRContext* context, const uint16_t bytes );

- pause_gc() opcode removed, tragic hack, especially in light of the above. That
  should always have been library calls and if the need arises that
  is where it will be ressurected
- added WRValue::technicalAsString(char* string, size_t maxLen, bool valuesInHex)  
  to support displaying debug values

- fixed up the hash to work for everything without a scrambler
- added delete to io:: lib
- implemented LittleFS for arduino

- changed calling function for function primitive to incluide context
- adding mult_event example for using multi-context
- added yield() functionality! always wanted it

3.2.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- more code size optiomizations (thanks again Manfred)
- io/file refinements for win32
- made all text files cr/lf consistent (unix style)
- added roadmap file

3.2.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed esp/embedded issue with unaligned 16/32 bit reads
- added a serializer! this will encode/decode WRValue including int, float, string, array,
  hash tables in any combination, refer to /tests/019_serialize.c for intended usage
- pursuant to the above, it is also possible to write/read serialized WRValues in a 
  single operation

3.2.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added directives to compile for the esp8266 toolchain
- integrated code optimization from Manfred, thank you!
- force the open in std::open to use the O_BINARY flag in all cases
- added array init function so they are exactly the right size
- specifically added array-handling functionality for returned values

3.2.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- wr_compile(...) now returns a WRError type
- streamlined and fixed EX_REFARRAY resolution so it will properly recurse/descend
- Deprecated file::read and file::write, now io::readFile and io::writeFile
- added: 

    io::open( name, [flags, mode] );
    io::close( fd );
    io::read( fd, [max_count] );
    io::write( fd, data, [count] );
    io::seek( fd, offset, [whence] ); 

- also added support for SPIFFS, LittleFS, Win32 and linux-ish io with:

    #define WRENCH_WIN32_FILE_IO
    #define WRENCH_LINUX_FILE_IO
    #define WRENCH_SPIFFS_FILE_IO
    #define WRENCH_LITTLEFS_FILE_IO
    #define WRENCH_CUSTOM_FILE_IO

    just defined the one you need in wrench.h

- wrench now understands octal as C: 023 == 19
- added macros for reading data from the code stream, including 8-bit for the case of 
  it being specially addressed ROM:
    
    READ_32_FROM_PC( P )
    READ_16_FROM_PC( P )
    READ_8_FROM_PC( P )

- changed function signatures to make a bit friendlier to use:
    WRValue& wr_makeInt( WRValue* val, int i );
    WRValue& wr_makeFloat( WRValue* val, float f );
    WRValue& wr_makeString( WRContext* context, WRValue* val, const unsigned char* data, const int len );

- added Library constants! So the concept of constant values that can be loaded at
  runtime when they weren't compiled in to begin with, this is accomplished with the new opcode:

    O_LoadLibConstant

  Which is appended to the instruction set, so it remains backward-compatible. Along with this the
  function:

    void wr_registerLibraryConstant( WRState* w, const char* signature, const WRValue& value );

  Has been added, which is called to load consts into the VM for access via code. The constants
  MUST be of the form: "A::B" and it is a run-time error if one is not found when called for:

    WR_ERR_library_constant_not_loaded

- refactored index/hashing functions to be more robust and take far less space, by combining
  the index operations into a single call. runs a touch faster and saved more than 10% code
  size
- fixed struct extra function call when parsing a trailing comma
- fixed crashing bug when you accessed a non-hash as if it were one

3.2.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed parse error where control chars are quoted f(")"); for example would fail
- calling a function that does not exist is now an execution error
- fixed spurious dereference from new struct code

3.2.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- bugfix release for negative array reference
- debug features are DORMANT and not meant for release yet

3.2.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed DEPRECATED call-function signatures
- added sys:: library and calls to set garbage-collector states and check for functions existence
	sys::functionExists
	sys::gcPause
- fixed bug in function calling where it was possible for the return vector to set the
  garbage-collect flag on the return frame.
- these names had been bothering and I finnaly came up with better ones:

	These are now !!DEPRECATED!!:
	WRContext* wr_allocateNewScript( WRState* w, const unsigned char* block, const int blockSize );
	bool wr_executeFunctionZero( WRContext* context );

    And have been replaced with:
    WRContext* wr_newContext( WRState* w, const unsigned char* block, const int blockSize );
    WRValue* wr_executeContext( WRContext* context );

3.1.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added functionality so  string + string  and string += string work!!
  its a teeny bit hack-ish but overall not that bad, and does not impact normal
  performance at all, it's only engaged if you actually use the strings functionality

3.1.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Trying to figure out how to add this-> ish functionalit
- Added new string functions:
    str::concat
    str::left
    str::trunc
    str::right
    str::substr
    str::trimright
    str::trimleft
    str::trim
    str::insert

3.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!NOTE: Code generated on 3.* is NOT compatible with 2.* and verse-visa !!

- new version sub-type added "build" 

- Actually ran wrench on a big-endian machine and it blew chow. short version:
  I THOUGHT I had been testing on big-endian using Raspberry-Pi since it's ARM but
  turns out (stop snickering!) That I was wrong about that

  So using Qemu and a PPC debian image I actually tested it on an [emulated] big-endian box
  and shook out all the bugs.

  This led me the conclusion that storing data natively as big-endian, a habit
  from my netork progamming, is stupid. It requires byte-swapping on every architechitecture
  this is likely to be used on, including embedded. So the "native" format of data in
  wrench is now Little-Endian, 

  tl;dr:
  
  this:

    ((int32_t)*(P+3) | ((int32_t)*(P+2))<<8 | ((int32_t)*(P+1))<<16 | ((int32_t)*(P))<<24)

  becoms this:

    (*(int32_t *)(P))
  
  with a pickup in speed and decrease of code size. so yay.
  bad news is this means pushing the major version since it is no longer binary compatible

- Taking advantage of non-binary-compatible to clean up the opcode order a bit and group
  some likes together.
- Added PPC (qemu/G4/debian) to test-platforms required to pass before release. It's
  slow at 266mhz single-core (wow.. there was a time...) but is big-endian so actually
  ensures cross-compatibility.
- fixed opcode error in corner-case of keyhole optimizer in index
- added opcode for indexed members into function call, they need to be dereferenced
  in order to work as expected

2.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Major API change to wr_callfunction(...) !!!!!!!
      No longer takes a "WRState*" since that is inside the context, this change was
      made some time ago and the API never caught up with it.
          The old calls are still in but deprecated, please update if you are using them
      it no longer returns an integer 'err' it now returns the WRValue* that is the
      return-value of the function. This means error-checks on it need to be
      inverted.
- WRValue::setInt( const int i )
- WRValue::setFloat( const float i )
- WrenchValue::operator int*()
- int* WrenchValue::asInt()
- WrenchValue::operator float*()
- float* WrenchValue::asFloat()
- WRValue& WrenchValue::operator[]( const int index )
- WRValue* WrenchValue::asArrayMember( const int index )
- int* WrenchValue::makeInt()
- float* WrenchValue::makeFloat();
- fixed warning with int/int32_t pointer confusion in 64 bit land
- fixed command-line strip/symbols flag to work properly

2.12 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added global function symbols and method to access them via c:
   WRValue* wr_getGlobalRef( WRContext* context, const char* label );
- added Helper object WrenchInt and WrenchFloat to facilitate handling
  wrench values in c
- fixed err strings
- added 'strip' options cs, cas, chs to cli to support removal of globals
- updated website, added some docs

2.11.1 (trivial release) --------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed len checking in asString() for char arrays

2.11 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added ESP32 libraries to track some work I'm doing with that platform
- fixed up arduino compile chain to be a bit more sensible
- thought I'd seen the last of the global/local variable issues but another one cropped up

2.10 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improving Arduino support
- Adding Esp32 support
- Updated the win32 build to VS2022
- separated the wr_run function into it's two parts: allocating the script
  then initializing it by running "function 0" with:
     // wr_run actually calls these two functions back-to back. If you want
     // to separate the process you can call them on your own.
     WRContext* wr_allocateNewScript( WRState* w, const unsigned char* block, const int blockSize );
     bool wr_executeFunctionZero( WRState* w, WRContext* context );
- Fixed null switch-body crash (who does that? well.. if you comment them ALL out...)
- Rewrote switch to properly handle local space, major bug that it wasn't before. This
  Represents a difference in the way the switch VM functions but actually _is_ reverse compatible,
  ...almost... the (Switch) case has a (uint16_t) cast which prevents it from functioning, so
  I do need to bump the major version darnit. 


2.09 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed 'const' from a few return types Arduino 2.x complained about
- fixed compiler error around indexing arrays with variables (oof)
- fixed "asString" for user-data arrays to be less stupid finding the values
- added enum types supported by c++11 for ease of debugging but made sure
  it is still fully compile-able under c++98

2.08 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added more debugging tools
- added WRENCH_FLOAT_SPRINTF to grant full floating-point format support to str::sprintf
- removed leading '0' from wrench version macro

2.07 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed order-of-operations problem with global/local division and subtraction

2.06 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- bugfixes

2.05 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- small gc optimization
- fixed issue #9 with the optimizer

2.04 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adding CallLibFunctionAndPop since it's coming up a lot (appended so major version same)
- fixed corner case where iterators did not hold references to their arrays so they
  could be gc'ed while being iterated! hard to induce this case, you have to do
  something silly like erasing the array while iterating but now it will just
  be sill instead of segfaulting :)
- Added string operation for constructing strings to call into wrench with

2.03 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added .isFloat() and .isInt() to WRValue
- fixed some array-centered pre/post inc/dec corners
- wrench now understands "userdata.b" to be equivilant to "userdata.b[0]" for the
  purposes of a raw array and wr_addArrayToContainer(...)
- fixed some raw array compares
- fixed small leak with re-opening multiple contexts, the fix
- added std_msg a messaging lib for sending/receiving messages across contexts
  a message is a key/value where the key can be anything but the value is only stored
  numerically, if a complex type is given the hash will be stored, the implications for
  passing allocated memory around is just too whacky

 	msg::read  -- read a message, optionally clear
	msg::write -- write a message
	msg::clear -- clear
	msg::peek -- returns true if a message exists

  load this with wr_loadMessageLib(...) and it is included with wr_loadAllLibs(...)

2.02 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added bounds checking for raw arrays
- fixed RAW_ARRAY access from c-side value lib
- fixed error where "negate" operation changed the target value permemantly
- added more RAW_ARRAY support

2.01 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed nasty optimization bug around not forgetting opcodes deep enough

2.00 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- wrench bytecode now expects a 32-bit CRC footer, this bytecode is checksummed before 
  run to prevent crashes by bad/garbage data
- wr_run now requires a size, so it can locate the CRC at the end and check the bytecode
- found a bunch of space optimizations, knocked almost 3k off the flash size!
- added (int) and (float) casting operators

1.82 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- changing release format to y.xx instead of y.x.z

1.8.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- RAM on small devices is precious, and fragmentation is really a problem. wrench's
  hash tables are bad for this becuase they are very flat, grow-on-collide. So I added
  a 'linear retry' semantic of size (mod / 8) which will attempt to find empty entries
  NEAR a collision. This has dramatically reduced ram use and fragmentation on modest
  size tables, at the cost of the occasional iteration on hit. The only real penalty is
  felt on a miss, and it's not large.
- Initial addition of an arduino library

1.8.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed value-to-array semantics for asInt() and asFloat()
- removed c++ constructor/destructor semantics from interpretrer, this saves a
  few cycles and at the same time allows large chunks of memory to be allocated
  simultaneously so should reduce RAM usage a bit too

1.7.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- reduced memory footprint a tad by shrinking data types in WRState
- fixed some compiler warnings from newer compilers
- fixed major bug in not preserving return values correctly
- removed "create globals" instruction in favor of always-init to save space
- allocate context and globals all in one go and removing constructor/destructor
  this should save a teeny bit of overhead and code space

1.7.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed WRENCH_JUMPTABLE_INTERPRETER from top-level, really not a user-visible
  thing
- added switch, linear and arbitrary flavors
- added WRENCH_REALLY_COMPACT to allow small-but-almost-full-speed WRENCH_COMPACT

1.6.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
- fixed error in compare logic surrounding GE/LE/GT/LT in keyhole optimizer

10/26/22 1.5.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added goto. sometimes it's just the right solution
- added optimized int/float to string so no more dependency on std/sprintf
- added optimized sprintf for string library
- added gc_pause( counts )  to pause the garbage collector 'x' counts when a large
  number of allocations is about to happen. The gc is hyper-aggressive which works
  great for small-memory embedded systems but slows down larger allocations
- fixed parsing of \0 -style escape sequences in single and double-quotes
- added struct array initting
- tranlate "null" into 0 wherever it is encountered
- added "compact" flag which will trade unrolled speed for very compact code,
  reduces compiler-only build to 21k on arduino, now it fits into everything!

10/15/22 1.4.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed unnused opcode
- fixed struct/param bug
- broke out a few other .h files
fixing: 
- #2 Can't build due to possibly uninitialized value
- #3 ISO C++ 17 does not allow register storage class specifier
- objs_linux/ dir not part of repo by default
- fixed failure to recognize missing semicolon parse error
- added Hash tables, initted with { k:v, k:v }
- added enums, they are free to the interpreter just cost some compiling overhead
- added single char recognition with ''
- adding string lib
- adding io lib
- partial-code execution removed

10/6/22 1.3.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added more compare optimizations
- changed function calling to be lower overhead by making "no return" the default,
  so now instead of always returning and then cancelling the return, the return
  value is ignored unless it's actually going to be used
  arduino compiles the interpreter (sans compiler) to 41k
- added array initialization
- added structures
- added "new" instances
- added inline initialization
- added optimized LL/GG/LG/GL loading for uncoimmon binary operations without 
  blowing the opcodes up the way add/sub/mul/div did. Those can be back-converted 
  if necessary
- optimized gc passes
- added ._count meta

9/27/22 1.2.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added 0b prefix for parsing binary numbers
- added catch for two label/literals in a row 
- changed the 6x6 arrays to 4x4 so the operands could be left-shifted instead of
  multiplied. This shows measureable gains on the embedded systems, no change to
  Intel and a slight loss on Ryzen
- added 16-bit loads for integers and indexes, reduces bytecode size considerably
- added super-instructions for binary operation + store so it never touches stack
  pretty big speed boost on all platforms
- require 1 less stack ewntry (from 3 to 2) to call a function
- added optimized inc/dec functions for faster [typical] for loops
- added optimized compareL/G instructions for common (x < 0) -ish cases
- optimized if conditionals more with a compare/jump combination instruction

9/11/22 1.2.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- removed need for context ID and just track the object directly
- added function to call a pre-indexed function

9/8/22 1.1.0 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- added jumptable interpreter
- added some "super" opcodes for more compressed bytecode:
   O_LiteralInt8ToGlobal
   O_LiteralInt32ToLocal
   O_LiteralInt8ToLocal
   O_LiteralFloatToGlobal
   O_LiteralFloatToLocal
   O_LiteralInt32ToGlobal
